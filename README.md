# Protein Characteristics

- Sequence
- Structure
- Function
- Interactions

then derive homologies, phylogeny, domains etc.

disorder proteins - either fully or disorder domains/stretches

## Collect and compare proteins

database ontologies - hierarchical
e.g. UniProt

download fasta for Hsp90 (P07900) and HtpG (P0A6Z3)

measure order disorder with IUPred2a on them

over the line means disorder 
both proteins are from the same family but in human and bacteria?

ANCHOR gives signal for interaction domains

## protein data bank to look at structure

downloaded pdb files - special file format for structural model from PDB
IDs: 2IOP E.coli , 5FWK Homo

## PDB 101

extra database with good illustrations - better than spaghettis

## Protein blast

to find homology or homologous sequences for phylogenetic experiments

downloaded the blast hits as fasta files
